# Contributing
This document is heavily WIP.

If you wanna contribute to `eza`, here are the absolute basics:
- your commit summary should follow conventional commits.
- your commits should be separated into small, logical chunks.
- reviewers may ask you to rebase your commits into more sensible chunks.
- your PR will need to pass CI and local `cargo test`.
- you may be asked to refactor parts of your code by reviewers.
